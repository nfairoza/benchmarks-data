- Increase the array size: Try setting it to at least 4x or 8x your last-level cache size. A common recommendation is 4-8 GiB per array.

#define STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE 320000000  /* Increase from 80M elements to 320M */

- Increase the number of iterations: The benchmark runs only 10 iterations, which may not be enough for accurate results.
#define NTIMES 100  /* Increase iterations */

Compile option:
gcc -O3 -fopenmp -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=320000000 -mcmodel=large stream.c -o stream-bin
